# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

### Overview
Research has been performed on synthetic beef and the strand of bacteria used to develop it. The research is compiled in a JSON file and data visualization has been used through Javascript to display the data as a dashboard.
### Resources
Files for the Data Visualization: index.html, plots.js, samples.json, 
Technology Stack: JavaScript, Plotly.js, HTML
Github website: https://samira786.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/
### Dashboard
Javascript is used to create-
1.	A drop down list of the Test subject ID
2.	Display Metadata info of the candidate
3.	A bar chart displaying the Top 10 Belly Button OTUs*
4.	A gauge chart displaying washing frequency
5.	A bubble chart displaying Sample Values and OTU IDs
•	OTU = Operational Taxonomic Unit – the categorization of bacteria based on sequence similarity
